            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of local developers and designers. 
                It quickly grew into a major international conference, recognized for its commitment to open source and emerging technologies. 
                Our first event featured 50 attendees; last year, we hosted over 5,000 guests from 40 different countries.
